				<p>The best attractions in Langkawi make the most of the natural landscapes, expansive parks, and iconic structures that no first-time visitor should skip on their travel itinerary. As one of Malaysia’s best-known and most popular beach destinations, the massive island is home to historical attractions, great fare, excellent diving opportunities, exciting nightlife and dirt-cheap shopping.<br><br>Langkawi’s pristine beaches – namely Datai Bay, Pantai Cenang, and Tanjung Rhu – are also rated among the best in the world while vast roads provide easy access to its vibrant beach towns. Due to the size of the island, Langkawi’s best attractions are best explored by rented vehicle. There are a few sights that you definitely need to check out before leaving this island, so check out our comprehensive list of the most popular Langkawi attractions.</br></p>

					<h2>1. Langkawi Sky Bridge</h2>
					<p>The Langkawi Sky Bridge is located at the 'end' of the Cable Car ride. One of the island’s highlights, it is a 410ft-long curved pedestrian bridge above Mount Mat Cinchang. It may sound like a cliché but it is really true - the views from here are simply stunning - great for those Kodak moments!<br><br>Located 2,300ft above sea level, the Sky Bridge is easily accessible by the Langkawi Cable Car. The journey to the top starts out at the Oriental Village in the upper northwest of Langkawi Island, near Pantai Kok. Once the cable car gets going it gets a little chilly as winds flow through the ventilation slits at the top, so put on a sweater beforehand.<br><br>The views on the way to the top of Langkawi’s second-highest peak include those of the Telaga Tujuh Waterfalls and the rainforest. After travelling a few hundred feet upwards, the cable car levels outs and stops at the Sky Bridge, the final station. Near where you disembark, there are dozens of stalls selling souvenirs, toys, snacks and drinks. Those with a fear of heights might be a little afraid of the altitude, but it is a very safe bridge with double steel railings and an enclosed wire mesh. The 1.8m wide bridge has two triangular platforms that act as ‘stops’ where you can admire the view and rest your feet.<br><br>Here, you’ll see a set of narrow stairs that cut through the forest leading to the observatory deck, the highest point where the sky and sea views are truly unobstructed. In fact you can even see Tarutao Island in Thailand. The end of the steel bridge that extends out from Mount Mat Cincang to a neighbouring mountain is the part of the Sky Bridge that is unforgettable. Although it is a hair-raising experience travelling across it, since the cable-stayed bridge actually curves 125m around a single support, it is truly worthwhile. Photo opportunities are plentiful: and the cold winds will no doubt result in lots of cosy group shots. Besides shopping for souvenirs at the stalls near the cable car, there is not much else to do here than to take in the views. Fun fact for Bollywood movie enthusiasts: the last scene of the Hindi blockbuster ‘Don: The Chase Begins Again’ was filmed here.</br></p>

					<h2>2. Dataran Lang</h2>
					<p>Also known as Eagle Square, Dataran Lang is one of Langkawi’s best known manmade attractions, a large sculpture of an eagle poised to take flight. A sight that greets visitors to the island via ferry, the 12 metre-tall statue is one of the island’s most instantly recognizable monuments.<br><br>Located at the southeast corner of Pulau Langkawi, besides offering beautiful views of Kuah Bay, Dataran Lang has beautiful miniature fountains, terraces and bridges, making it the ideal place for those postcard-perfect holiday photos. The square is a good place to watch ferries ply across the harbour but plan a trip here early in the morning or late in the evening when the sun is at its least intense.<br><br>The reddish-brown eagle at Dataran Lang was built as an emblem of the island. According to folklore Langkawi’s name came from two Malay words – ‘helang’ (eagle) and ‘kawi' (reddish brown): hence langkawi.<br><br>Adjacent to the CHOGM Park and Taman Lagenda Dalam Langkawi, the monument is also within walking distance of some of the best duty-free shops in Langkawi and the Jetty Point Mall – chocolates and alcohol are especially good buys here.</br></p>

					<h2>3. Langkawi Cable Car</h2>
					<p>The entrance for the Langkawi Cable Car, which takes visitors all the way up to Mount Mat Cincang, Langkawi’s second highest peak,  is located in The Oriental Village in the upper northwest of Langkawi Island, near Pantai Kok. Entering the village and passing through the pleasant oriental garden and souvenir shops, visitors make their payment at a counter before stepping onto an escalator which brings them to the cable-car pedestal.<br><br>Once in, Langkawi Cable Car ascends; you’ll begin to notice the temperature dropping and a windy breeze begin flowing into the cabin through ventilation slits at the top.<br><br>After around 600 metres, the cable car reaches the first station, where you disembark to either; take another cable car up to the peak, or lull around the observatory deck and admire the magnificent surroundings. Most will not spend too long here, as the view from the peak is even more amazing. After a short queue, you can grab another cable car and ride up another wire cable which doesn’t rise too sharply, though the initial jolt of the car leaving the second station can feel quite unnerving.</br></p>

					<h2>4. Langkawi Underwater World</h2>
					<p>Spread across nearly six acres, Underwater World Langkawi is one of the island’s best-known attractions. Located at the southern end of Pantai Cenang (almost at the border of Pantai Tengah), beside the Zon duty-free shopping centre, it is Malaysia’s largest aquarium. The huge white-washed structure houses more than 200 different species of marine and freshwater fish including harbour seals, rockhopper penguins, sharks, giant rays and the enormous Amazonian arapaima – the biggest freshwater fish in the world.<br><br>Once you enter the air-conditioned interior, Araipamas (the world's largest freshwater fish) can be seen in a medium-sized tank in front of the entrance door.<br><br>The complex is divided into three sections: Tropical Rainforest, Temperate and Sub-Antarctic. The Sub-Antarctic was probably the most popular section – the ‘penguin-arium’ houses cute little rockhopper and black-footed penguins that cause quite a few people to crowd around the exhibit to get a good look. Other highlights of the tourist-friendly Underwater World include an Educational Resource Centre, a cafeteria and a three-dimensional (3D) theatre – be sure to watch the short movie about Michael, a little prehistoric fish and his life before becoming a fossil. Lastly there’s a giant walk-through six million litre underwater tunnel tank which houses an extensive number of fish including sharks, giant stingrays and green turtles.</br></p>

					<h2>5. Langkawi Wildlife Park</h2>
					<p>Langkawi Wildlife Park is a five-acre animal sanctuary along Jalan Ayer Hangat. Officially launched in 2002, it is a tropical garden with over 2,500 exotic birds from 150 species, such as canaries, owls, eagles, toucans, hornbills and flamingos. The park also features a walk-in aviary with a 15-metre manmade waterfall, a duty-free retail outlet and animal-feeding sessions.<br><br>About 10 minutes from Kuah, the complex has a massive aviary that’s home to 1,500 birds flying freely, with sections that strongly resemble the natural habitats of each different species of birdlife. Langkawi Wildlife Park is a popular stopover for most tours on Pulau Langkawi (the main island) and the indoor park predictably is a popular spot on rainy days.<br><br>Ideal for travelling families and animal lovers, feeding sessions are held throughout the day, where you can get up close with donkeys, deer, eagles and pelicans, under the supervision of experienced handlers.<br><br>Within the complex are several retail outlets, including a duty-free zone, souvenir kiosk and a crystal store. Located at the back of the gallery, you can browse through an extensive display of rare crafted and raw crystal ornaments from Brazil and China. Besides purchasing the crystals, you can also learn about their curative and therapeutic properties from the friendly staff.</br></p>
